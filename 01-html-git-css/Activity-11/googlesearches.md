1. "can't push/pull repositories after updating macOS"

2. "switch cases syntax javascript"
3. "add hover effects to navigation bar"
4. "ajax call error "No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.""
5. "jquery $('.btn').on('click', function(){//does something}) not working on buttons" 
... Looks like this error comes from the on click function being a "direct" binding, and the fix is to instead use a "delegated" binding that can get bound to elements made dynamically. 
6. "ajax call to API endpoint not returning appendable data"
7. ".foreach syntax for mozilla -W3Schools"
8. ".sort method on array [1, 6, 5, 11, 34, 2] incorrectly producing [1, 11, 2, 34, 5, 6]"
9. "css animations working on chrome but not firefox"
... The fix for this problem is fairly simple, you need to add a "-moz" prefix so that firefox knows how to read your animation.  
10. "for loop to console log an array using setTimeout logging undefined"
