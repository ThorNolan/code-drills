My Solution
======================================

Because Jerome and Ricky are the fastest (so it says), the quickest way will be for one of them to cart the flashlight back and forth. So...

1. Jerome and Ricky cross in 2 mins
2. Jerome brings the flashlight back (1 min! wow! so fast!)
3. Robert and Sasha cross the bridge in 10 mins
4. Ricky brings the flashlight back in 2 mins
5. Jerome and Ricky cross together, taking 2 mins for a total time of 17 minutes (though maybe Jerome makes Ricky quicken his pace just a tiny tiny bit so they get there just a couple seconds under 17 minutes)
