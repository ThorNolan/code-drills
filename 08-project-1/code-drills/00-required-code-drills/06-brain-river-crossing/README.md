## Farmer Crossing the River

_Wait... No code???_

Nope, no writing code for this exercise. Algorithms are about more than just writing code to automate tasks. On a deeper level, they're about reallu understanding problems, and breaking them down to their fundamental parts. Thinking about how to solve problems without worrying about syntax is good practice for thinking about algorithms at their conceptual level.

### Instructions

For this exercise you will not create a function. Your job instead is to get a poor farmer and his livestock across a grueling river.

The farmer needs to get a chicken, a fox and a bag of grain across a river. He's in quite the pickle though. The only boat around is a small, rickety thing that can only carry him (the farmer) and one of his cargo at a time. That means whenever the farmer crosses the river, he'll have to leave at least two of his animals/possesions behind.

What's worse, if he leaves the chicken and fox alone together, the fox will eat the chicken. If he leaves the chicken and grain alone, the chicken will eat the grain. 

Using only the farmer's rickety boat and its rules, help him get across the river with all of his companions.

There is no "trick" answer to this problem

## My solution, in steps:

1. First step would be to take the chicken across in his boat, so that the fox and the grain are left alone together and the chicken won't get eaten. 
   
2. Then the farmer has to go back to the first side of the river, and this time he grabs the grain.
   
3. He then has to take the grain over the river to where the chicken is waiting.
   
4. This time, the farmer takes the chicken back with him, so it won't be alone with the grain and eat it, so now just the grain is on the destination side of the river. 
   
5. He then takes the fox back over so it won't eat the chicken and it's safe to leave it with the grain.
   
6. Finally, he makes one last trip back, retrieves his chicken, and brings it over to the destination side of the river where his fox and grain are already waiting.
